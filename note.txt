MiddleWare
- function that takes a store as an argument takes next as an argument and takes an action as another function
- any fucntion that happends between actions and reducer
- logger log every time action 
- will use middleware to do asych action
- Eventually, actions to check payload or action to see if it's a function to see if we need to do it asych
- all actions go through middleware
- Thunk middleware  
  - expects dispatches to be functions - if action is a function
  - if it's a function it will do some other things, if not a function calls next and behaves normally
- 

Actions can be functions that take dispatch - they take dispatch because they can dispatch plan 

thunk middleware checks if it's a function or not
when function invoked makes API call and dispatched a synchronouse action
